# keybow-pager

lua code to extend the keybow pimoroni system to support four "pages", thus extending the number
of possible operations.

The four pages can be switched as tabs using the topmost four buttons. This changes the behavior of
the operations on the remaining buttons

This branch is including my changes to the files suitable for a Linux machine
